Shared Dependencies:

1. Data Schemas:
   - `SVGData`: This schema will hold the processed SVG file data, including stroke paths and pen coordinates.
   - `Features`: This schema will hold the extracted features from the handwriting styles, such as stroke shapes, pen pressure, slant, curvature, etc.
   - `ModelParameters`: This schema will hold the parameters of the trained machine learning model.
   - `GeneratedHandwriting`: This schema will hold the data of the generated handwriting styles.
   - `EvaluationMetrics`: This schema will hold the evaluation metrics for the generated handwriting styles.

2. Exported Variables:
   - `processedSVGData`: This variable will hold the processed SVG data.
   - `extractedFeatures`: This variable will hold the extracted features from the handwriting styles.
   - `trainedModel`: This variable will hold the trained machine learning model.
   - `generatedHandwritingStyles`: This variable will hold the generated handwriting styles.
   - `evaluationResults`: This variable will hold the evaluation results for the generated handwriting styles.

3. Function Names:
   - `preprocessSVGData()`: This function will process the SVG data.
   - `extractFeatures()`: This function will extract features from the handwriting styles.
   - `trainModel()`: This function will train the machine learning model.
   - `generateHandwritingStyles()`: This function will generate new handwriting styles.
   - `evaluateHandwritingStyles()`: This function will evaluate the generated handwriting styles.
   - `refineModel()`: This function will refine the model based on the evaluation results and user feedback.

4. Message Names:
   - `SVGDataProcessed`: This message will be sent when the SVG data has been processed.
   - `FeaturesExtracted`: This message will be sent when the features have been extracted.
   - `ModelTrained`: This message will be sent when the model has been trained.
   - `HandwritingStylesGenerated`: This message will be sent when new handwriting styles have been generated.
   - `HandwritingStylesEvaluated`: This message will be sent when the generated handwriting styles have been evaluated.
   - `ModelRefined`: This message will be sent when the model has been refined.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual implementation may require additional dependencies based on the specific requirements and the chosen technology stack.
